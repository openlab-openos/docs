In this section, we will describe how to use the Openos command-line tools to
create a _wallet_, to send and receive BTG tokens, and to participate in the
cluster by delegating stake.

To interact with a Openos cluster, we will use its command-line interface, also
known as the CLI. We use the command-line because it is the first place the
Openos core team deploys new functionality. The command-line interface is not
necessarily the easiest to use, but it provides the most direct, flexible, and
secure access to your Openos accounts.

## Getting Started

To get started using the Openos Command Line (CLI) tools:

- [Install the Openos CLI Tool Suite](./install.md)
- [Introduction to our CLI conventions](./intro.md)
- [Create a Wallet using the CLI](./wallets/index.md)
- [Choose a Cluster to connect to using the CLI](./examples/choose-a-cluster.md)
