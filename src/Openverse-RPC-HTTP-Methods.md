Openverse nodes accept HTTP requests using the [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specification.

 > ***"For JavaScript applications, use the [openverse-web3](https://github.com/openlab-openos/openverse-web3) library as a convenient interface for the RPC methods to interact with a Openverse node. For an PubSub connection to a Openverse node, use the Websocket API."***


## Transactions

**Default port: ** `8899` 

- [http://localhost:8899](http://localhost:8899)
- [https://api.devnet.openverse.network](https://api.devnet.openverse.network)

## Request Formatting
<!-- methods -->

To make a JSON-RPC request, send an HTTP POST request with a `Content-Type: application/json` header. The JSON request data should contain 4 fields:

- `jsonrpc: <string>` - set to "2.0"
- `id: <string | number | null>` - a unique identifier for the request, generated by the client. Typically a string or number, though null is technically allowed but not advised
- `method: <string>` - a string containing the method to be invoked
- `params: <array>`- a JSON array of ordered parameter values

Example using curl:

```bash
curl https://api.mainnet.openverse.network/ -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getBalance",
    "params": [
      "83astBRguLMdt2h5U1Tpdq5tjFoJ6noeGwaY3mDLVcri"
    ]
  }
'
```

The response output will be a JSON object with the following fields:

- `jsonrpc: <string>` - matching the request specification
- `id: <number>` - matching the request identifier
- `result: <array|number|object|string>` - requested data or success confirmation

Requests can be sent in batches by sending an array of JSON-RPC request objects as the data for a single POST.

### Example Request

The commitment parameter should be included as the last element in the `params` array:

```bash
curl https://api.mainnet.openverse.network/ -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getBalance",
    "params": [
      "83astBRguLMdt2h5U1Tpdq5tjFoJ6noeGwaY3mDLVcri",
      {
        "commitment": "finalized"
      }
    ]
  }
'
```

### Definitions


- Hash: A SHA-256 hash of a chunk of data.
- Pubkey: The public key of a Ed25519 key-pair.
- Transaction: A list of Openverse instructions signed by a client keypair to authorize those actions.
- Signature: An Ed25519 signature of transaction's payload data including instructions. This can be used to identify transactions.



### Health Check



Although not a JSON RPC API, a `GET /health` at the RPC HTTP Endpoint provides a health-check mechanism for use by load balancers or other network infrastructure. This request will always return a HTTP 200 OK response with a body of "ok", "behind" or "unknown":

- `ok`: The node is within `HEALTH_CHECK_SLOT_DISTANCE` slots from the latest cluster confirmed slot
- `behind { distance }:` The node is behind distance slots from the latest cluster confirmed slot where `distance > HEALTH_CHECK_SLOT_DISTANCE`
- `unknown`: The node is unable to determine where it stands in relation to the cluster
